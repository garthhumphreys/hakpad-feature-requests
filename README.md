# Hakpad Feature Requests
This repository is used to track [Hakpad](https://hakpad.io) feature requests and discussions.

Click [here](https://github.com/garthhumphreys/hakpad-feature-requests/issues) to open a new feature request.

We welcome any ideas about how to make Hakpad better for your use case. Unless there is overwhelming demand for a feature, it might not get implemented immediately, but please include as much information as possible that will help people have a discussion about your proposal:

1. Use case: What are you trying to accomplish, in specific terms? Often, there might already be a good way to do what you need and a new feature is unnecessary, but itâ€™s hard to know without information about the specific use case.
2. Is there a workaround? Is this a more convenient way to do something that is already possible, or is there some blocker that makes a workaround unfeasible?

Please keep in mind that feature requests should be well specified and unambiguous, to have the greatest chance of being worked on by a contributor.

The [issues](https://github.com/garthhumphreys/hakpad-feature-requests/issues) area of this repo should be used to discuss new features and possible implementation designs. You can show your support for (or against!) features by using GitHub reactions, or by adding meaningful details which help the feature definition become more clear.
